# Smart-Home-Simulator

## Overview
This is a **Smart Home Simulator** built using Java and Swing. It simulates various smart home devices, such as **smart lights, smart AC, and smart door locks**, allowing users to interact with them via a graphical user interface (GUI). The project also tracks **energy consumption** for each device.

## Features
- **Smart Devices:** Includes a Smart Light, Smart AC, and Smart Door Lock.
- **Graphical Interface:** Built with Swing to interact with devices easily.
- **Energy Tracking:** Each device consumes energy, and the total usage is displayed.
- **Command Execution:** Devices respond to commands like **ON/OFF, LOCK/UNLOCK, and SET_TEMP**.
- **Status Display:** Shows real-time status updates of all devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Java** (Object-Oriented Programming, Interfaces, Swing for GUI)
- **Swing** (JFrame, JButton, JTextArea, JScrollPane) for UI
- **Observer Pattern** to manage devices efficiently
